# LED-Controller-using-serial-port-library-CPP-Arduino-nano
This repository is created to control LED ws2812b with c++ using serial port library. 

# Getting Started
A project which enables a serial communication between arduino nano and c++ file. Idea behind this is that\
arduino can not process the information, this problem is overcome by using c++ file to process the information and then\
sending commands to arduino nano to control the LED stripws2812b.

# Prerequisites and hardware required

Arduino nano + LED ws2812b strip + jumper wires + Power supply (5v- 3.6 A) - recommended.
Note that, here we are using 60 leds which requires 3.6 A (for 60 pixels) which means, we need 60 mA per pixel.

# Test Environment

Windows 10 + Arduino IDE + Code Block IDE (Works with any IDE).

# Installation & Setup

To begin with LED ws2812b , It is recommended to watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hJyyUTflXA
make sure you install the required Adafruit libraries for LED ws2812b.
