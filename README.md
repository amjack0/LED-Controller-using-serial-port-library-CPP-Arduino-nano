# LED-Controller-using-serial-port-library-CPP-Arduino-nano
This repository is created to control LED ws2812b with c++ using serial port library. 

# Getting Started
A project which enables a serial communication between arduino nano and c++ file. Idea behind this is that,\ 
arduino can not process the information this problem is overcome by using c++ file to process the information and\
sending commands to arduino nano to control the LED stripws2812b.
